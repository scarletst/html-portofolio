<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Iulia.
</p>

<p>
  Or Julia - people call me both. It's the same thing, although Julia is the easiest version to get right.
  </p>

 <p>
  I'm 25 years old, born and raised in Romania.

  I've been working as a Copywriter for the past 2+ years; ever since I was still pursuing my Master's Degree. It started as a regular job so I could get some extra money in college. Then, it ended up becoming a thing I actually enjoy doing. And being good at it, too.

<p>
  Language barriers are not an obstacle. I'm dedicated to making sure communication is clear and meaningful, regardless of language or cultural background.

  Recently, I started getting into Web Development. It's a long way to go, but I am willing to learn as much as I can. It's fun, new and gives me a big sense of accomplishment. This is just one of my very first projects. It's not much, but it's better than nothing!
