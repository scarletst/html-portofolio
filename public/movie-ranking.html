<h1>The Best Movies According to Julia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Iron Man (all of them)</h3>
<p>I don't usually watch movies. But I'd gladly rewatch all the Iron Man or Avengers movies. Binge watch them, even.</p>

<h3>The Flash</h3>
<p>Well, it's not a movie but it's a great series. Keeps you hooked.</p>

<h3>Doctor Who</h3>
<p>I don't watch movies. But again, I have a series recommendation. Doctor Who is a classic.</p>
